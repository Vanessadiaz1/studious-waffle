# OctoAcme Role Engagement Checklist

This checklist helps teams identify when to engage key roles across the project lifecycle to reduce rework, improve handoffs, and maintain quality.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

- Review this checklist during project kickoff and planning
- Identify which roles are needed based on project scope and complexity
- Schedule role involvement proactively, not reactively
- Adapt the checklist to your specific project needs

---

## Initiation Phase

**Objective**: Define problem, stakeholders, and high-level scope

| Role | Engagement Point | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Project Manager (PM)** | Required from start | Coordinates kickoff, stakeholders, timeline |
| **Product Manager (PdM)** | Required from start | Defines problem statement, success metrics |
| **Developers** | Early involvement | Provide technical feasibility input, rough estimates |
| **UX/UI Designer** | Engage for user-facing features | Early user research prevents late design rework |
| **Technical Writer** | Optional early consult | Identify doc scope, release note requirements |
| **DevOps/Release Engineer** | Engage if infrastructure changes | Surface deployment constraints early |
| **Support Lead** | Engage if customer-facing | Share known pain points, support readiness needs |

---

## Planning Phase

**Objective**: Define scope, resources, milestones, dependencies, acceptance criteria

| Role | Engagement Point | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Project Manager (PM)** | Required | Creates project plan, manages dependencies, risks |
| **Product Manager (PdM)** | Required | Prioritizes backlog, defines acceptance criteria |
| **Developers** | Required | Provide detailed estimates, technical design |
| **UX/UI Designer** | Required for UI features | Deliver wireframes/mockups before engineering starts |
| **Technical Writer** | Plan doc milestones | Align doc work with release timeline |
| **DevOps/Release Engineer** | Review deployment plan | Confirm CI/CD readiness, infrastructure needs |
| **Support Lead** | Include in planning | Set support training and runbook expectations |

---

## Execution Phase

**Objective**: Build, test, review, iterate

| Role | Engagement Point | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Project Manager (PM)** | Continuous | Tracks progress, manages risks, facilitates standups |
| **Product Manager (PdM)** | Regular check-ins | Validates features against acceptance criteria |
| **Developers** | Continuous | Implement features, review code, test |
| **UX/UI Designer** | Ongoing reviews | Validate implementation matches designs, iterate |
| **Technical Writer** | Parallel drafting | Draft docs alongside code to catch gaps early |
| **DevOps/Release Engineer** | Pipeline support | Support CI/CD setup, deployment testing |
| **Support Lead** | Preview upcoming changes | Prepare runbooks, flag support-heavy features |

---

## Release & Deployment Phase

**Objective**: Deploy, verify, announce

| Role | Engagement Point | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Project Manager (PM)** | Required | Coordinates go/no-go, stakeholder communication |
| **Product Manager (PdM)** | Required | Final validation, release decision |
| **Developers** | Deployment support | Monitor rollout, troubleshoot issues |
| **UX/UI Designer** | Final UI validation | Confirm production matches designs, no visual bugs |
| **Technical Writer** | Publish docs | Ensure help content is live before feature launch |
| **DevOps/Release Engineer** | Execute deployment | Deploy, monitor, coordinate rollback if needed |
| **Support Lead** | Briefed and ready | Support team trained, monitoring early feedback |

---

## Retrospective & Continuous Improvement Phase

**Objective**: Capture learnings, identify improvements

| Role | Engagement Point | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **All Roles** | Participate in retrospective | Cross-functional insights improve future projects |
| **Project Manager (PM)** | Facilitate retrospective | Document action items, track improvements |
| **Product Manager (PdM)** | Share outcome metrics | Measure success against goals |
| **Developers** | Technical learnings | Share what worked, what to improve |
| **UX/UI Designer** | Design feedback | Capture usability insights from launch |
| **Technical Writer** | Doc feedback loop | Identify doc gaps based on support inquiries |
| **DevOps/Release Engineer** | Release process review | Improve deployment reliability, cycle time |
| **Support Lead** | Customer feedback | Share trends, recurring issues, feature requests |

---

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ **Late design involvement**: Engaging UX after engineering starts → costly redesigns
- ❌ **Docs as an afterthought**: Writing docs post-release → inaccurate or incomplete content
- ❌ **Release engineering only at deploy**: No CI/CD setup during execution → last-minute issues
- ❌ **Support blindsided**: No advance notice of changes → unprepared support team, poor customer experience

---

## Tips for Success

✅ Invite all relevant roles to project kickoff
✅ Schedule recurring check-ins with each role based on phase
✅ Use this checklist in project charters and planning docs
✅ Adapt based on project complexity and team structure
✅ Review role engagement in retrospectives to improve
