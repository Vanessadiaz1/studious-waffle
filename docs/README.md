# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This guide provides a quick overview of how we run projects, from initial idea through release and retrospective. Our approach emphasizes customer-first thinking, iterative delivery, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions. Whether you're a new team member or refreshing your knowledge, this README will help you navigate our processes and find the right resources.

OctoAcme projects follow a structured lifecycle: **Initiation** (validate the business need and create a project one-pager), **Planning** (break work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria), **Execution** (build, test, and iterate with daily standups and PR workflows), **Release** (deploy with pre-flight checks and smoke tests), and **Close/Retrospective** (capture learnings and action items). Each phase has defined roles: the **Project Manager (PM)** coordinates delivery, schedules, and risk; the **Product Manager (PdM)** defines outcomes and prioritizes the backlog; **Developers** implement features and participate in reviews; **QA/Testing** validates quality; and **Stakeholders** provide inputs and approvals. This collaborative model ensures transparency and accountability across the delivery pipeline.

Communication and quality assurance are central to our success. Teams maintain a consistent cadence with **daily standups**, a **weekly PM + PdM sync**, and **monthly stakeholder updates**. We rely on a single source of truth for project status and use standard templates for weekly updates and incident communication. On the quality side, all code changes go through a **PR workflow** with automated **CI tests, linting, and security scans**. Before releases, teams run **end-to-end smoke tests** and follow a **release checklist** that includes rollback plans and post-deployment verification. If issues arise, we have clear escalation paths and conduct **blameless retrospectives** to continuously improve.

These processes are documented in detail across multiple guides. Each guide covers a specific phase or topic, providing templates, checklists, and best practices. Use the links below to dive deeper into any area relevant to your current project.
